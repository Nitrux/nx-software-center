# NX Software Center [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Nitrux/nx-software-center.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Nitrux/nx-software-center)

_A portable Software Center for Portable Applications thanks to [AppImage](https://appimage.org/)._

You can now easily explore and get your favorite applications (in some cases 
directly from their original authors) no matter which GNU/Linux distribution 
are you using as long as it is newer than Ubuntu 14.04.

Say goodbye to things like:
 * the applications I want is not in my distribution repositories
 * missing our outdated libraries or conflicts

**Just download and run!**
